# Claude Code Session Igniter

Start a Claude Code session programmatically to trigger the 5-hour rate-limit window at a fixed time every working day.

Using a Claude Code SDK is stupid because they all rely on a pre-installed Claude CLI ! Use simple Shell and forget Python, Rust and others \o/

`claude -p --max-turns 1 --no-session-persistence "hello"`
